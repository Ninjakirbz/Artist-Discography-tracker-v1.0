Hiii this is a simple program to help organise discographies

You can add artists to the list by just writing in the text file however make sure to press enter when done to leave a line open.

The format to write it in the file is as follows:

Position in list,artist name,total albums by artists,how many albums you've heard

the commas are important so don't delete them and don't use commas in the artist name

Alternatively just do it in the program like intended :3
